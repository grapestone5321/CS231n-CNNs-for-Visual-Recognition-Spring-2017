Lecture 1 gives an introduction to the field of computer vision, discussing its history and key challenges. We emphasize that computer vision encompasses a wide variety of different tasks, and that despite the recent successes of deep learning we are still a long way from realizing the goal of human-level visual intelligence.

Keywords: Computer vision, Cambrian Explosion, Camera Obscura, Hubel and Wiesel, Block World, Normalized Cut, Face Detection, SIFT, Spatial Pyramid Matching, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, PASCAL Visual Object Challenge, ImageNet Challenge

### Lecture 2: Image Classification

Aug 12, 2017

Lecture 2 formalizes the problem of image classification. 

We discuss the inherent difficulties of image classification, and introduce data-driven approaches. 

We discuss two simple data-driven image classification algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors and Linear Classifiers, and introduce the concepts of hyperparameters and cross-validation.

Keywords: Image classification, K-Nearest Neighbor, distance metrics, hyperparameters, cross-validation, linear classifiers
