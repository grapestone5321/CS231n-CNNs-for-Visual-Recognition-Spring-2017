## Lecture 1 | Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

Aug 12, 2017


Lecture 1 gives an introduction to the field of computer vision, discussing its history and key challenges. We emphasize that computer vision encompasses a wide variety of different tasks, and that despite the recent successes of deep learning we are still a long way from realizing the goal of human-level visual intelligence.

Keywords: Computer vision, Cambrian Explosion, Camera Obscura, Hubel and Wiesel, Block World, Normalized Cut, Face Detection, SIFT, Spatial Pyramid Matching, Histogram of Oriented Gradients, PASCAL Visual Object Challenge, ImageNet Challenge
